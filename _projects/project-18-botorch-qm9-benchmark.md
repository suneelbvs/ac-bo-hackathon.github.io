This project will investigate the application of multi-objective Bayesian optimization (specifically EHVI- and parEGO-based methods) to benchmark several multi-objective optimization tasks with QM9 dataset. The objective is to develop specific guidelines about the choice of surrogate and acquisition functions in the context of Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization for molecular property optimization.
