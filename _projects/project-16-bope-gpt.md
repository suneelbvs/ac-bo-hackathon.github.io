When facing a chemistry problem with many outputs, you might want to optimise one output first, like the yield of a reaction, or look for trade-offs for several outputs in a multi-objective fashion. In the latter, objectives/outputs may not be equally important (even across iterations) and very often, a human ranks these outputs to help with future experimentation. Here we will use Bayesian optimization with preference exploration, BOPE [1,2] (implemented in Botorch), to guide optimisation in a synthetic multi-output dataset, and we will apply it later to a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis dataset [3,4]. This algorithm selects importance (or utility) of the outputs based on pairwise comparison, and the small twist is that this comparison will be done by a large language model (LLM) instead of a defined utility function [5]. We welcome anyone that wants to contribute or know more about preferential Bayesian optimization, multi-input multi-output datasets and LLM prompting.
