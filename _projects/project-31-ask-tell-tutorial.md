This tutorial is aimed at experimentalists in wet lab settings, who have data workflows in an ask/tell format. We will start from a simple, more user friendly package (Scikit-Optimize) and use real-world data from voltammetry to demonstrate setting up an ask/tell workflow. We will then demonstrate migrating to Ax, a more advanced platform with more capabilities. We hope this tutorial will streamline the dry-lab lead-time for wet-lab experimentalists setting up Bayesian optimization workflows in ask/tell or human in the loop formats.
